Scouts:
-fly around diagonally, bouncing off stuff they cannot move past (check)
-shake any trees they come by as they fly around randomly        (check)
-shoot any gardeners they see                                    (check)
-report the locations of any trees they find                     ()
-have a better search algorithm for enemy gardeners
-gang up on enemy gardeners
-Have a good heuristic of whether this map is rotationally symmetric or has a line of reflection

Archons:
-Listen and remember all reports of trees
-Act as a sort of "google maps". Soldiers can tell it their location and their goal, and it gives them a direction to move in
-Constantly hire gardeners
-Stay put, stop broadcasting position
-Somehow keep track of how many gardeners there are and maintain at least a certain number!
-Move, but avoid nearby gardeners. Else, stay put but have gardeners avoid you

Gardeners:
-Create more space before spawning trees
    -Learn how to wander around
    -Learn how to look out for nearby gardeners and how to walk away from them
    -Once far enough away from any gardeners or neutral trees, start spawning trees
    -The more gardeners already alive, the farther you should walk from the archon (spawn point)
-Have gardeners tend 10 trees instead of 5
-Build more scouts and fewer trees at the very very beginning



Plans:
Build 1 gardener and 1 scout immediately. Have the scout find trees and shake them aggressively.
Use our knowledge of maps being rotated or reflected to aggressively find their home base and kill their gardeners
